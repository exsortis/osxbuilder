## osxbuilder

This is a (highly opinionated) setup script that automatically configure my OS X systems to a "usable" state following a clean OS X install. This gets me as pretty close to useable in a realively short period of time.

**NOTE:** It is presumptious in use of my `dotfiles` Github repo, which will break for you given it is a private repo. I would suggest commenting out that section of the script prior to use. Everything else should work well.

## How To Use

1. Select 'Download Zip' from the Github [page](https://github.com/tekbuddha/osxbuilder) or from your own fork. 
2. Unzip `osxbuilder.zip` by double clicking. 
2. Install XCode Command Line Tools from [Apple](https://connect.apple.com).
2. cd ~/Downloads/osxbuilder
3. bash ./osxbuilder.sh
4. Profit!
